# textaoblocker
Core of the Textão Blocker Chrome extension.
This project utilizes the concepts of the JaaS (Joke as a Software) paradigm.

You can find the extension on [Chrome's webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/textão-blocker/ecbjjmhhbommmagebjlbcildmblmcpdc)

I'm not maintaining this project anymore. Eventually it'll stop working due the many changes facebook does on the structure of the page.
